Ask HN: what words would you use to describe your favorite programming language?

A 1 min. survey: http://plwords.herokuapp.com/

Basically, I'd like to build tag clouds for different programming languages such as ruby, scala, java, python, clojure, C, C#, etc. The words would be collectively chosen by hackers themselves (language practitioners, say). 

I hope that obtained results will be somewhat representative of the language communities, without aiming at conducting a serious experiment though.

Later, I'd like to see if people agree for a given PL. Also, if hackers easily recognize PLs when facing a given tag cloud obtained through the survey. Provided I'm able to collect enough data, I'll update the website with results (including generated tag clouds).

Thanks!
